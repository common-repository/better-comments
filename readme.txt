Better Comments allows you to easily style and customize your comment form and comments section, in just a few clicks.

== Description ==
Better Comments is a great tool to help you style and customize your comment form and your comments section, in just a few clicks.

It saves you from having to meddle with your child theme's CSS, just select the options you need and you're all set.

Here's a glimpse of what you can do with Better Comments:

**Comment form**

*   customize the look and feel of your comment form fields: border, radius, background and text colors
*   match the submit button with the colors of your site: border, radius, background and text and hover colors, dropshadow
*   highlight the fields as they are selected and typed in
*   set a Comment Policy section that can sit before or after the comment textarea, and define its look and feel
*   stack all fields in the comment form, to mimick a mobile view
*   move the comment field to the bottom of the form
*   remove the URL field

**Comment section**

*   set a custom default avatar for non-users
*   allow users to upload their own image avatar, within their profile
*   define a custom avatar shape among: circle, triangle, rhombus, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, bevel, rabbet, or message
*   hide the comment's date
*   design the Reply button to your liking: border, radius, background, text, hover colors, padding, text-decoration

<hr style="width: 80%;margin: 4rem auto;border:1px solid #EEF2F5;height:1px;">

[Better Comments Premium](https://utopique.net/products/better-comments/ "Better Comments Premium") provides other sets of options that allow you to:

*   enable comments quicktags for your audience to format their comments nicely: you can define built-in quicktags (bold, italic, link etc) or define your own quicktags within the admin panel
*   access time-saving admin controls: oEmbeds in comments, disable admin self-notifications, add referrer to notifications, allow admin to comment on closed to comments posts
*   reduce SEO errors with smart redirects and keep the SEO juice flowing
*   increase security levels and reduce spam: shutdown trackbacks, disable comments cookies, discard comments posted with a numeric name, discard people impersonating registered members
